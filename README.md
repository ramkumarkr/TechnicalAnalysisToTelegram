Based on the charting patterns, you will start seeing outputs of our experimental and educational scanner. To start with, the scanner looks at Nifty50 stocks only. You can find the current list of scrips scanned everyday [here](https://github.com/ramkumarkr/TechnicalAnalysisToTelegram/blob/master/scrips_list.txt). If you have specific needs, please submit [this form](https://forms.gle/E5Eq42ZhrpfJ4SQu7). We will evaluate such requirements on a periodic basis and new scrips will be added based on number of requests for a given scrip.

For any generic questions or feedback, use the [issues section](https://github.com/ramkumarkr/TechnicalAnalysisToTelegram/issues).

Thank You!
