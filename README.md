# TechnicalAnalysisToTelegram

**Update: 8th Aug,2020 - No more pattern screeners will be run on this channel. Also no more ope=high/open=low scanners**

**Disclaimer** : The analysis outputs are provided purely for educational purpose. The system by itself does not provide any buy or sell signals. Any trading decisions you take based on these signals are purely your own responsibility. We do not take responsibility of your trades or the profits or loss from it.

**How to Use**

Join Telegram Channel at https://t.me/TechnicalAnalysisToTelegram . You will start seeing messages there within the next day when market is open.

~~Based on the charting patterns, you will start seeing outputs of our experimental and educational scanner. To start with, the scanner looks at the two key indexes - Nifty50 and NiftyBank along with Nifty50 stocks only. You can find the current list of scrips scanned everyday [here](https://github.com/ramkumarkr/TechnicalAnalysisToTelegram/blob/master/scrips_list.txt). If you have specific needs, please submit [this form](https://forms.gle/E5Eq42ZhrpfJ4SQu7). We will evaluate such requirements on a periodic basis and new scrips will be added based on number of requests for a given scrip.~~

~~Sample [scanner code] will give you an idea how broadly this works.~~

~~Currently, the scanner looks for the following chart patterns
- Hammer
~~- Shooting Star
- Inverted Hammer
~~- Hanging Man
- Engulfing Pattern (There is no differenciation of bullish/bearish. Use the charts to find it out yourself)
~~- Dark Cloud
- Piercing Pattern
~~- Harami (Again, does not have bullish/bearish differenciation)
- Evening Star
~~- Morning Star
- Marubozu~~

~~Additionally, some experimental (and educational) intra-day signals are being evaluated. For example Open = High and Open = Low . These signals are evaluated at 9:46am on days when market is open.
Additional signals such as opening range breakout and breakdown with 1 hour initial range period is in the plan~~

For any generic questions or feedback, use the [issues section](https://github.com/ramkumarkr/TechnicalAnalysisToTelegram/issues).

Thank You!
